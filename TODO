- replace the call to system() when setting the statusbar info. Xlib will work and is capable, 
  but will be an endeavor to figure out.
- Immplement the ability to use output with dualstatus dwm patch. More specifically, allow for alignment justification on 
  the secondary statusbar (left, center, right) and automatically pad it accordingly. User should be able to ultimately 
  say, "%sleep %volume %cpu %cpubar %mem %membar ; %c%music%rtime%r<message>
- Immplement music support of mocp





BUGS:
- Clock seconds are displayed erradically due to the update_clk not being by the second. 
  A mechanism to allow for dynamic updating of information (EG. static || constant) fields 
  in the statusbar string. This should achieve the lower memory, yet give a smooth time clock.
- Fix sleepd bug when dstat first starts. If the system was just booted, sleepd does not create a sleepd.ctl file
  until the first toggle/run of sleepd hibernation.
