- A function to display lock status, only when active.
- bitmap support (dependant upon support of the WM).
- Incorporate better return status for help()
- Clean up setup() and possibly rearrange.
  \- Specifically fix the try-except issue of a file not existing, but the
  directory doesn't have write permissions. Do so for both try-excepts.
- Move the /var/run files into a single directory in /var/run?
- Setup the ability to pass message back and forth between the client and
  server.
- Incorporate flat file logging to system messages.
- replace the call to system() when setting the statusbar info. Xlib will work and is capable, 
  but will be an endeavor to figure out.
- Implement code to test whether or not sleepd is installed, and use it appropriately. 
- Make the output of statusbar_str() be a fixed width up to 4 digits (3 decimal points left of decimal, one right of).
    \- This is already incorporated, though still needs some pruning and standardized applications.
