- Incorporate better return status for help()
- Clean up setup() and possibly rearrange.
  \- Specifically fix the try-except issue of a file not existing, but the
  directory doesn't have write permissions. Do so for both try-excepts.
- Setup the ability to pass message back and forth between the client and
  server.
- replace the call to system() when setting the statusbar info. Xlib will work and is capable, 
  but will be an endeavor to figure out.
- Immplement the ability to use output with dualstatus dwm patch. More specifically, allow for alignment justification on 
  the secondary statusbar (left, center, right) and automatically pad it accordingly. User should be able to ultimately 
  say, "status' = left, music = center, time = right".
- Immplement music support of mocp
