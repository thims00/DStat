- Add a feature to display if sleep is on. Support began 10/20/2014.
- A function to display lock status, only when active.
- bitmap support (dependant upon support of the WM).
- Incorporate better return status for help()
- Add code to ensure only one "daemon" is running at any given time.
- Add code to force cleanup of the environment for stale /var/run/ files.
- Incorporate better error handling.
- Clean up setup() and possibly rearrange.
  \- Specifically fix the try-except issue of a file not existing, but the
  directory doesn't have write permissions. Do so for both try-excepts.
- Move the /var/run files into a single directory in /var/run?
- Setup the ability to pass message back and forth between the client and
  server.
- Incorporate flat file logging to system messages.
- Standardize some of the weird/uncertain/scattered data validation into a single function.
- replace the call to system() when setting the statusbar info. Xlib will work and is capable, 
  but will be an endeavor to figure out.
- Add client side code to detect the daemon not running and error out appropriately.
